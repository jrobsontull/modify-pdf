## Why?

`pdf-lib` provides a thorough toolset for manipulation of PDF files within JavaScript environments. This library provides an abstraction over `pdf-lib` for common tasks such as copying, merging, rotating, inserting and more!

## Getting Started

### npm

Install the package using the package manager of your choice.

```bash
npm install modify-pdf
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add modify-pdf
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm install modify-pdf
```

<br/>

`modify-pdf` can then be imported into your app as follows:

```tsx
import { loadLocalDocument, rotateDocument } from 'modify-pdf';
import { PDFDocument } from 'pdf-lib';

const document: PDFDocument = await loadLocalDocument('example.pdf');
const rotated: PDFDocument = rotateDocument(document, 90); // 90Â° rotation
```
